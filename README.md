# alice-analysis-utils
The repository consists of a series of utilities with the aim of helping the user in running the analysis on AAFs, checking the logs, producing the QA output, etc.

## Setup repository

## Utilities to run user analyses
The macro **runTaskUtilities.C** contains a series of methods that can ease the way the user launch his/her analysis, allowing to transparently submit it locally, on AAF or on grid.

The utility provides two main methods:
```C++
TMap* SetupAnalysis ( TString runMode, TString analysisMode,
                      TString inputName,
                      TString inputOptions,
                      TString softVersions,
                      TString analysisOptions,
                      TString libraries,
                      TString includePaths,
                      TString workDir,
                      Bool_t isMuonAnalysis = kTRUE )
```
which takes care of setting up the analysis manager with the correct handlres, add some general tasks if required (see below), and load the required libraries locally. It returns a TMap containing some parsed parameters.

And
```C++
void StartAnalysis ( TString runMode, TString analysisMode,
                     TString inputName, TString inputOptions )
```
which should be called after you've added your analysis task to the manager and actually runs the analysis.

#### Arguments explained
The _runMode_ parameter strictly depends on the _analysisMode_. They will be discussed together in the following.
- **analysisMode** can be:
  - _local_
    - **runMode**:
      - _test_ or _full_ : execute full analysis
      - _terminate_ : launch only AnalysisTaskSE::Terminate
  - _grid_
    - **runMode**:
      - _test_ : use local pc as a "working node" of the grid
      - _full_ : launch jobs on grid
      - _merge_ : launch merging jobs on grid
      - _terminate_ : merge run-by-run output on grid, copy the result on the local pc and launch the Terminate of the task
  - _saf_ or _saf2_ or _vaf_ (proof mode):
    - **runMode**:
      - _test_ : launch analysis locally with prooflite
      - _full_ : launch analysis on proof
      - _terminate_ : launch only the task Terminate (in PoD it first get the output file from the proof machine)
- **inputName**:
  - ESD or AOD filename (in local mode)
  - dataset-like search string, e.g. Find;BasePath=/alice/data/2015/LHC15o/000244918/muon_calo_pass1/AOD/;FileName=AliAOD.Muons.root; (in proof and grid mode)
  - txt filename containing:
     - list of local ESD or AOD files (in local mode)
     - list of dataset-like search strings (in proof and grid mode)
     - root file with a file collection (in proof mode)
- **inputOptions** (optional): it is a space-separated list of keywords. The following are recognized:
  - _MC_ : load MC handler if needed
  - _EMBED_ : embedding production (needs MC handler, but use non MC option for other things, e.g. Physics Selection)
  - _AOD_ or _ESD_ : the runTaskUtilities tries to guess if you're running on ESDs or AODs from the inputs specified in _inputName_, but you can write it explicitly in case it fails
- **softVersions**: in proof and grid mode, specifies the root/aliroot/aliphysics version to use. Syntax: _aliphysics=version,aliroot=version,root=version_. One can put only one of the three. The order does not matter.
- **analysisOptions** (optional): it is a space-separated list of keywords. The following are recognized:
  - _NOPHYSSEL_ : do not add the physics selection task in the list of tasks (it is added by default when running on ESDs)
  - _CENTR_: add the centrality tasks
  - _OLDCENTR_ : add the old centrality task (on ESDs)
  - _MIXED_ : use input handler for event mixing
  - _SPLIT_ : in proof mode, provides an output run-by-run
- **libraries**: it is space-separated list of libraries/par files/classes needed by your task. Notice that they should be provided in the correct order, following the dependencies. They can be:
  - library of aliphysics, e.g. libPWGmuon.so (notice that the .so is compulsory!)
  - par files, e.g. PWGmuon.par (if the par file is not found, it is automagically created)
  - your local class not in aliphysics, e.g. AliAnalysisTaskMyTask.cxx (no need to specify the corresponding .h, but it must be in the same directory)
  - your local AddMyTask not in aliphysics, e.g. AddMyTask.C: it will be copied on the output dir and loaded
- **includePaths**: the space-separated list of include paths needed by your analysis, e.g. ". $ALICE_ROOT/include $ALICE_PHYSICS/include"
- **workDir**: the directory in which all of the files needed to run the analysis will be copied. If one re-runs the command inside MyTask, the files are not overwritten. This allows to re-run the same analysis later on. This is also the directory used in AliAnalysisAlien::SetGridWorkDir in grid mode. 
    Please note that the workDir argument must be set in order to allow the analysis task to run while in grid or proof modes. One has two options to inject an option:
    -  one could specify a value for the correspondant parameter, in order to let the SetupAnalysis method automatically assign the AliEN working directory path:
        ```
        TMap* SetupAnalysis ([...],
                             TString workDir="/AliEn/relative/path/to/the/chosen/folder",
                             Bool_t isMuonAnalysis = kTRUE )
        ```
    -  one could directly act on the AliEn plugin:
        ```
        TMap* SetupAnalysis ([...]);
        AliAnalysisAlien* plugin = static_cast<AliAnalysisAlien*>(AliAnalysisManager::GetAnalysisManager()->GetGridHandler());
        plugin->SetGridWorkingDir("/AliEn/relative/path/to/the/chosen/folder");
        ```

- **isMuonAnalysis**: it is the default...just keep it ;)


### Example
Let us suppose that you have the task AliAnalysisTaskMyTask in PWG/muon.
You can easily run your code with the following macro:

```C++
void runTask ( TString runMode, TString analysisMode,
               TString inputName,
               TString inputOptions = "",
               TString softVersions = "",
               TString analysisOptions = "",
               TString taskOptions = "" )
{

  gROOT->LoadMacro(gSystem->ExpandPathName("$TASKDIR/runTaskUtilities.C"));

  SetupAnalysis(runMode,analysisMode,inputName,inputOptions,softVersions,analysisOptions, "libPWGmuon.so MyTaskNotInAliphysics.cxx AddMyTaskNotInAliphysics.C",". $ALICE_ROOT/include $ALICE_PHYSICS/include","MyTask");

// AliAnalysisAlien* plugin = static_cast<AliAnalysisAlien*>(AliAnalysisManager::GetAnalysisManager()->GetGridHandler()); // Uncomment it if you want to configure the plugin...

  Bool_t isMC = IsMC(inputOptions);

  gROOT->LoadMacro("$ALICE_ROOT/PWG/muon/AddMyCommittedTask.C");
  AliAnalysisTaskCommittedMine* task = AddMyCommittedTask(isMC);

  MyTaskNotInAliphysics* taskMy = AddMyTaskNotInAliphysics(isMC);

// AliMuonEventCuts* eventCuts = BuildMuonEventCuts(map); // Pre-configured AliMuonEventCuts
// SetupMuonBasedTask(task,eventCuts,taskOptions,map); // Automatically setup "task" if it derives from AliVAnalysisMuon

  StartAnalysis(runMode,analysisMode,inputName,inputOptions);
}
```
**CAVEAT:** remember to export the TASKDIR, so that it points to alice-analysis-utils

To run it on a local AliAOD.root, just run:
```bash
root -l
.x runTask.C("full","local","pathTo/AliAODs.root","","");
```
